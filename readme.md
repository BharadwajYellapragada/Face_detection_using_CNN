# Face Detection using CNN and UMDFaces
A facial recognition system or face detection is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database. It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person by analyzing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape. for more information click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system)

In this repository, I'll be using [UMDFaces dataset](https://www.umdfaces.io/) which is a face dataset divided into two parts
1. Still Images - 367,888 face annotations for 8,277 subjects.
2. Video Frames - Over 3.7 million annotated video frames from over 22,000 videos of 3100 subjects.

Implementation is divided into 5 phases
1. Dataset download
2. Tools & Libraries
3. Data Pre-Processing
4. Building the model
5. Analysing the results
